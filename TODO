-------DONE-------
Add a `subject' field to comments
Web-based installer
changed users from 4 types to 3
newsys_help_get_id() - returns the ID of a help item, either constant or string with unknown detection
Wrap configuration settings in a newsys_conf() call
remove chdir() calls
fix CSS expression() XSS holes
make sure all output functions handle $of instead of creating their own
Some scripts use variables in the global scope which can collide with other variables which might be
	present in a page that includes a newsys page, overwriting the original (your) script variable's value.
	'ns' -> 'newsys' var scope in suggested pages
join join.php and admin/user-add.php to a single file? is_logged_in() ?
optimize remove_info() to not do any thing when target data is not found
The function mail_is_valid() checks for a valid e-mail address. In some cases, when a user's
	e-mail service provider is not "properly" configured, this function will end up returning
	information that the particular e-mail address is invalid when in actuality it may not be.
prefix user-defined fields with 'ud_' or 'cust_' or something for namespace conflict avoidal
stop CLRF injection in mail() calls

------PENDING------
check form posts for HTTP_REFERERs within the domain?
add NEWSYS_SKIP_CHECK to pages that don't need it
	create optimizations in pages that don't need it
when diffing the current database with new user fields, if the value is required, append
	'default "$default_value"' to SQL ALTER ADD statement

---------TODO----------
revisions to the caching engine:
	-removal
	-revision
		all in one file? - thread-safe
			create toc at the beginning
		compress it when its not open?
in providing user preferences, should admin values be cached and compared between each invocation
	to make sure user prefs do not surpass default/max values?
web-based front-end for admins to edit newsys-config.inc settings
(cache?) compression support
make sql more ansi sql-compliant and less mysql-specific
add a 'preview' button to 'add story/add comment'
option to estimate max field size during install
convert user.php and other worthless files into the core 'search' file
checkbox/radio/etc support to user-defined fields
xrss - extensible rss - would allow flexibility in rss generation
	-requires me to learn a lot more about rss
calendar-display-like search results, drop-down menu for year
richer-feature parsing/expiration engine
	eg directives: file-$FILE, template-$TYPE-$ID
per-user preferences (# results to display, etc)
	'last login' field for users to determine 'what's new'

crypt user sessions
	Make another key for the user sessions to encrypt with it instead - keys a,b data c -> b(a(c)) == a(b(c)) ?
dynamic templates? php code in generation?
sessions can be optimized to not enough connect to rdbms during an auth session [disadvantage:
	admins don't use much resources typically]
after story removal, should the rss generator replace the latest story or just eliminate the removed story?
during validation rejection, old values should be used as defaults in form fields
make adjustments to 'overview' field
Add templates to space templates (<hr /> between stories)
add an option to prohibit js in various HTML attributes
when serious configuration options are changed, should data be rebuilt? (eg, hier_comments)

The automatic link-from-URL building algorithm is not perfect. It will miss some URLs (as well as turn non-URLs
	into hyperlinks). Please report any bugs you find to the authors in the doc/AUTHORS file.
After clearing the cache, sometimes error messages will arise the first time a new cached template output is generated.
Some newsys scripts use chdir() to more easily handle file manipulation routines. They assume in their
	default context some directories to be relative to the value in include_path. Make sure '.' is
	in your include_path and the order in which these directories are searched for file inclusion are sane.

Due to some browsers and caching issues (with the browser), when logging in without using log-in
	redirection (when you click on an action before authorizing yourself, then are asked to
	log-in, and are aftewards redirected to the original, appropriate page to fulfill the desired
	action), the log-in page can redirect to itself, in theory presenting the user with a list of
	actions, but will instead see the log-in page present in their browser's cache.
The 'newsys_use_cache' option, when turned off, doesn't *really* not utilize the caching system. Some caching
	is still required, such as the information containing which stories are the latest, or if special
	configuration options have been changed which will require some rebuilding. *Some* alternative
	methods exist (such as re-querying the database, in the case of the 'latest_stories' info cache).
add 'show all results' when *_limit are set to 0
add a 'max_comment_threshold' var to limit the maximum depth hier commenting can reach
allow stories to span multiple pages
add a 'page_break' directive to distinguish when story pages should be broken up
'allow_comment_edit' option
img on the fly to protect email spam
emoticons
add a buttload of options to the command line installer for verbosity granularity and batch processing
newsys_get_template($template_name,$prefs)
	-- remove $dbh and always specify the data
		-- allows speedups such as     while ($r=$dbh->fetch){get_template($tmpl,$r)}
editable page extensions - search.foo
parsers, eg ms dos, pdf
