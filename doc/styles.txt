Newsys 1.1 Documentation
By Jared Yanovich <jaredy@closeedge.net>

Newys output is highly customizable, contrary to popular belief. In
this document, we will address how and in what ways to do exactly this.

CPL OF Layer
The first layer ground out by Newsys is that of the Common PHP Library
(CPL) Output Formatter (OF). The configuration directive from
newsys-config.inc `of_type' controls which type of (available) OF
output type will be used.

For regular Web pages, you'll probably want to use `HTML,' the value
already set in the distribution. If you have another medium for which
you'd like Newsys to provide output, simply change this value to the
desired medium supported by OF and you're done.

If you do not like the output provided by OF, you can inherently make
your own OF type (most likely derived and highly related to OF::HTML).
This way, you can control every single piece of output provided by
Newsys before it reaches its final destination.

CSS Layer

The second layer of control you have as an administrator is that of the
CSS layer. Newsys defines a rich set of specific CSS classes that most
of its output binds to. By providing CSS styles for the following
CSS classes, you will have complete control over the formatting of
Newsys' output:

	Name			When used
	---------------------------------------------------
	newsysButton		Submit inputs, button elements
	newsysData1		Regular content
	newsysData2		Alternating regular content
	newsysDesc		Descriptive labels, content
	newsysInfo		Emphasized, informative content
	newsysHeader		Page headers
	newsysFooter		Page footers
	newsysTable		All tables
	newsysCheckbox		Checkbox inputs
	newsysTextArea		Textarea elements
	newsysSmallTextArea	Smaller textarea elements

You can further refine styles on output generated by Newsys by using
more specific selectors, such as

	newsysHeader a

for example, to control links inside header elements.
