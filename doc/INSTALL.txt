Installation

	Installation of Newsys is relatively a straight-forward process.
Once the package is unzipped, you should end up with a `newsys'
directory inside the directory which emerged from the unzipping process:

	$ tar zxf newsys-1.1.tar.gz
	$ cd newsys-1.1
	$ ls newsys

This `newsys' directory contains all the libraries and suggested scripts
used by Newsys. It also contains many other goodies. Copy this to the
ideal location, for example, your Web site root:

	$ cp -R newsys ~/public_html
	$ ls ~/public_html/newsys

Next, you can go into automatic configuration or stay in manual. Should
you decide to go into automatic installation, load up, in this case:

	http://yourdomain.com/~you/newsys/install/web-install.php

This is the file that is located here:
`newsys-1.1/newsys/install/web-install.php' You can follow the rest of
the installation steps from here.

You also have the choice of using the command-line installer. A PHP CLI
binary is required for this procedure however. Simply run:

	$ php newsys/install/cmd-install.php

And follow the procedures.

Should you decide to go it alone, here are the tasks that need to be
done:

1) SQL must be generated and run on a database server. You will have to
edit `newsys/install/create.sql.in' and change all `@@VARS@@' with their
appropriate values. Here are the list of variables:

	@@PASSWORD_LEN@@	The length of encrypted passwords
	@@CRYPT_KEY_LEN@@	The length of the key used to encrypt
				passwords
	@@USERNAME@@		The first Newsys administrator account
				username
	@@PASSWORD@@		The first Newsys administrator account 
				*encrypted* password
	@@EMAIL@@		The first Newsys administrator account
				e-mail address

You may select from the following values for the length of the
password/key (in this order):
	
	If your system supports		Password length	Crypt key length
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	Blowfish			60		29
	MD5				34		15
	Extended DES			13		9
	Default				13		2

The encrypted password, as noted above, will be the value returned by 
the internal Newsys API function `newsys_crypt()'. However, to use this,
you will first need to generate a crypto key. You can use the following
script to accomplish both of these tasks:

	<?php
		# This is to prevent Newsys from interacting
		# with the environment
		define('NEWSYS_SKIP_CHECK',TRUE,TRUE);

		# Load the Newsys libraries
		require "path/to/newsys/newsys.inc";

		# Generate a crypto key
		$key = newsys_t_gen_key();

		echo "Put this key in newsys-config.inc: $key\n";

		# Inform Newsys of our key
		newsys_conf('crypt_key',$key);

		# YOUR PASSWORD HERE
		$password = "s3cret";

		$enc_password = newsys_crypt($password);

		echo "Your encrypted password is: $enc_password\n";
	?>

2) Newsys must be configured. As noted in step (1), this requires
generated a crypto key. If using the script given above, save the key
found in the output of that script as the `crypt_key' directive value
found in `newsys-config.inc'. Consult `doc/directives' for more
information on the different types of values that should be given
to Newsys directives as defined in `newsys-config.inc'.

3) Set up the templates. There is a default set of templates located in
`newsys/install/templates-dist' which provide basic functionality. The
template system provides lots of control over the output that Newsys
generates. Consult `doc/templates' for more information on the Newsys
templation system.

4) Set up the cache. Whereever `cache_dir' is pointed to from 
`newsys-config.inc', the permissions/ownership must be set correctly so
that your Web server can read, write, and alter files in this directory.

Once finished, remove the `newsys/install' directory.
