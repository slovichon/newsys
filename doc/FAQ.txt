Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why do I get a blank page when loading `/newsys'?
A: This is the result of any number of misconfigurations. To be sure,
check the server error log for specific problems. The following
situations may have occured:

	`newsys-config.inc' could not be loaded. The directory in which
	this file is placed must exist in PHP's `include_path' directive
	value.

	CPL libraries could not be loaded. The directory in which the
	root of the CPL libraries directory is placed must exist in
	PHP's `include_path' directive value.

	Your version of PHP is out of date. Either turn some features
	off (such as RSS), or upgrade your version of PHP. This will be
	pretty obvious if you check your server error log and see things
	such as `undefined function "array_key_exists()"'.

	A Newsys suggested page wasn't loaded. There is no index.html in
	the `newsys' page, as the standard default for page loading is.
	A common index many like to use would be `stories.php' or 
	`summary.php'.

	Other types of misconfiguration. Make sure the `sys_root' and
	all other Newsys directives are properly configured.

Q: How can I change the look of how things from Newsys output?
A: Read the `doc/styles' and `doc/templates' documentation.

Q: How can I add custom fields to stories, comments, and/or user sign-
ups?
A: Consult the `doc/user-fields' documentation.
