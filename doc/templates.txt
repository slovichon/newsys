Templates Documentation

Templates provide a powerful grasp over how stories should be
displayed. With a few tidbits to keep in mind, you can easily be on
your way to creating robust, precise templates for your site.

Scope

As the author of your own template, you have much freedom in things
such as variable and function naming. There are, however, some
pitfalls for which you should watch out.

Variables definitely off-limits for purposes of changing (or using
as custom variables in your template) are as follows:

	$templates_dir		Location of the templates directory
	$cache_dir		Location of the cache directory
	$_use_cache		Whether or not caching has been
				turned on
	$_type			The template type
	$_id			The identifier string for the
				expansion of a template for some
				particular input

As just mentioned, you may use these variables in your templates, as
you may need to, but it is highly recommended that you do not alter
their values in any way.

Additionally, Newsys allows you to control precise behaviors when
dealing with template expansion and caching. The following variables
help refine control to the Newsys administrator:

	$NO_CACHE		Whether or not this particular
				template expansion should be cached

Available Resources

You may use any resources you like in your templates. However, there
are a few already provided for you by Newsys.

There exists an $args variable which more or less contains arguments,
or input parameters, for a particular template. Depending on the
template, you may have any where from zero to many values in this
array. They can be access with normal PHP subscript notation:

	$args[0]	Always the template type, also available in
			the variable $type (see `Scope')

	$args[1]	Input arguments providing unique data for
	$args[2]	a particular template.
	...
	$args[N]

Default Templates

You may of course use the Newsys API to create your own templates
for other purposes than those that Newsys provides, or use the default
ones Newsys comes with:

	Type		Arguments
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	comment		Story ID, Comment ID

		Comment display
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	end_comment	None

		Used at the end of a nested level of hierarchical
		comments
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	footer		None

		Appended to most every page outputted
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	header		None

		Prepended to most every page outputted
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	preview		Story ID

		Used to present an overview of a story
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	profile		User ID

		User profile
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	quick_footer	None

		Appended to pages of less priority focusing on an
		arbitrary topic
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	quick_header	None

		Prepended to pages of less priority focusing on an
		arbitrary topic
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	start_comment	None

		Used at the start of a nested level of hierarchical
		comments
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	story		Story ID

		Story display
	-----------------------------------------------------------

Other Conventions

Sometimes situations arise when you'd like to cancel the building of
a template (such as a request to display a story which was deleted).
The Newsys templation engine provides mechanics for specifying build
failure when such a situation arises.

In the template include (content structure) file, the `.inc,' the
return status is used to indicate whether such success or failure has
come about. A return status of zero (`0') or any false value indicates
that something arwy has come about, the corresponding `.t' file is NOT
sourced, and empty output is returned by the templatation engine
(which can be checked for successful/failure templation building). A
return status of one (`1') or any non-false value indicates success
and the build process will continue as normal.

Guidelines

Let it be mentioned to sort of abstract the content layout and content
structure, which is easily achieved (and recommended) in the Newsys
templation system. The `.t' content layout template should be used
solely for specifying the common output of whichever template it is
being used for. This file should contain no computations or
calculations. Any processing should be done in the corresponding `.inc'
file, and saved in variables or another manner used in the `.t' file.
